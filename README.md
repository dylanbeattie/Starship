# Starship

Starship is a .NET interpreter for the [Rockstar](https://codewithrockstar.com) programming language.

It uses Pegasus, a PEG parser generator for .NET, to parse Rockstar programs into an abstract syntax tree, modelled using .NET
classes to represent various program elements - blocks, loops, conditionals, etc.

The Starship.Rockstar.Interpreter then 'runs' your program by interpreting the abstract syntax tree.

## Why 'Starship' ?

It's a Rockstar tradition to name interpreters and compilers after rock bands... so if .NET was a rock band, what 
band would it be? Only one answer, really... ;) 

First, .NET is kinda enterprise-y, and Starship actually called their greatest hits album [Starship Enterprise](https://open.spotify.com/album/38uy9OtGLS5byFFgvOkBqm?si=X1SAijlnTOK2EnvyoMK_JQ).

Then there's the whole Jefferson Airplane > Jefferson Starship > Starship naming confusion, which kinda reminds me
of .NET Framework vs Core vs Standard - not to mention that lyric from 'We Built This City'

> Someone's always playing corporation games
>
> Who cares they're always changing corporation names

If you're not familiar with Starship, check 'em out. They're great. The [guitar solo on 'Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now'](https://youtu.be/3wxyN3z9PL4?t=171) is particularly epic.
